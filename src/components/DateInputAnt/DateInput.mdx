# DateInput component
## This component uses Ant Design Date Picker


Docs and Examples: [https://ant.design/components/date-picker](https://ant.design/components/date-picker)

 - ðŸ”¥Bundle Size: 1.3MB minified. 388.9k gzipped
 - ðŸ”¥Has a dependency of "rc-picker", which in turn has a peerDependencies of "moment", which we would like to avoid
 - Pretty easy implementation
 - Documentation was not great. Looks like there are less configuration options than some of the other date picker components.
 - Range results are returned as an array. I haven't seen an option to return an object.
 - Lots of additional parameters not used in this example.
