# DateInput component
## This component uses Ant Design Date Picker


Docs and Examples: [https://ant.design/components/date-picker](https://ant.design/components/date-picker)

 - Pretty easy implementation
 - Range results are returned as an array. I haven't seen an option to return an object.
 - Lots of additional parameters not used in this example.
