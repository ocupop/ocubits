# DateInput component
## This uses react-datepicker

This component is very flexible in terms of how the inputs can be formatted. It can be one field, one field with a range, or two fields with a range. This was more difficult to set up, but I think if we set this component up properly from the start it could be easy to implement.

Here is the documentation.
[https://reactdatepicker.com/](https://reactdatepicker.com/)

Lots of features not yet implemented:
 - adding an icon
 - Time input
 - Excluding and filtering dates
 - Adding custom classes to the DOM
 - lots of callback options (onCalendarOpen, onCalendarClose)
 - close on scroll
 - modal window version
 - custom header, month picker, time picker.
 - displaying multiple months


 With all of these available options, it could lead to a complicated form component, which could be more than we need?
