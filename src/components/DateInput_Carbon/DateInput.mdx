# DateInput component
## This component uses "[Carbon Design Systems Date Picker](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/date-picker/usage/)"


Docs and Examples: [https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/date-picker/usage/](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/date-picker/usage/)

 - Date ranges are accomplished by using two date-input fields with a wrapper component. onChagne output an array with two values.
 - styles for ALL carbon comonetns are imported, which is 616k, Just the datepicker styles could be compiled from the scss source. (I think we would need to do this with PostCSS, right?)
 - The author has [their own storybook page](https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-datepicker--range-with-calendar) to demo the component
